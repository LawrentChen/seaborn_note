# Seaborn Note

Seaborn basic visualization note（with Pandas)，aiming to observe data directly.

The content is mainly from Qiang, Chen. *Machine Learning and Python Application*. Actually Seaborn's [official gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html) provides plenty of sample figures with code snippet. But it is still more convenient for me to make this warm-up kit myself.
